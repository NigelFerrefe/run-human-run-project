        It's a bright, sunny day in Crete, perfect for a first day on the job.
        As the new keeper of the labyrinth, you feel proud and powerful, and you
        stride through the labyrinth with the confidence of a legendary beast.
      </p>
      <p>
        But suddenly, disaster strikes! You pat yourself on the side and, oh no,
        the keys to the cages are gone! They're not in your pocket or inside
        your lunchbox full of roasted villager thighs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prisoners, watching their golden opportunity, begin to scurry out of
        their cells like ants at a picnic. "Great," you think, "this is exactly
        how I wanted my first day to go."
